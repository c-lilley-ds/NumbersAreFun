        <h2>Presidential Birthplace Dashboard</h2>

         <p> I created a spreadsheet with publicly available information on each
         President. I imported the spreadsheet into Tableau Public. I created three 
         visualizations of the number of Presidents born in the state. One portrays
          the mainland states, one shows Alaska, and one portrays Hawaii. Despite
         Ohio's nickname, the 'Birthplace of Presidents', more presidents were 
         born in Virginia than any other state.</p> 
        <h2>Sample Contact Highlighter</h2>
        <img src="Sample Contact Highlighter.png"height="240"width="320"/>
         <p> When I started this project the client had a contact list that had a 
         messy dataset that was difficult to read due to visual impairment. I cleaned the data in a new spreadsheet so I could keep the original data intact. Then I used excel formulas to 
         fill the contacts into an INSERT statement into a SQL script and created a
         MySQL database. I cleaned the data again with a focus on removing irrelevant
         information. I exported the new data into an XLSX spreadsheet and imported it into 
         Tableau Public. I created a dashoard using a simple text visualization with 
         a filter shown on the dashboard. The dashboard is designed for simplicity
         so that the client can easily see it. The client is visually impaired 
         and has trouble reading small fonts. The image shows a sample using 
         fictitious information to maintain privacy.  </p>
