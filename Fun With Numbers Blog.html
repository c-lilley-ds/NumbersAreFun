         <p> Today I decided to start a blog. I do not have time today to post
          much so I will post a fact I discovered from a project I completed.
          More U.S. presidents were born in Virginia than any other state.</p>

         <p> Today I changed the color of my header to black, changed the links in it to white text, and removed the underlines. I also realized that
      there is no reason not to integrate elements of other portfolios into mine if they look more visually appealing.</p>
